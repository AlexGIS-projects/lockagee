Lockegee Mountain, also known as Lockegee Rock is a popular rocky overlook in Morehead, KY near Cave Run Lake off Clark Mountain West Rd.
Graffiti can often be spotted all along the trail leading up to the overlook and on the rock outcrop itself. Hikers must climb a short [rock scramble](https://goo.gl/maps/fxELp1mxfqj6Gp1a6) to make it up to the overlook. The most popular feature is "*alligator rock*" which requires a fairly easy climb between two rock walls in order to mount.
